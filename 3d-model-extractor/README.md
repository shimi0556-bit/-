## 🚀 What is This?

Ever visited a website with amazing 3D models but couldn't download them because the download button was broken or didn't exist? This extension solves that problem.

**3D Model Extractor** monitors all network traffic and page content to automatically detect 3D model files across every common format, then provides a clean interface to download them with a single click. When auto-detection misses something, the Network Inspector lets you flag any request — even ones served with non-standard URLs or content types — as a model and download it directly. No more digging through DevTools or manually copying URLs.

### Why Use This Extension?

- 🔍 **Automatic Detection** - Finds models without manual searching
- 🧬 **Multi-Format Support** - GLB, GLTF, M3F, 3MF, FBX, OBJ, USDZ/USDC, STL, PLY, DAE, 3DS, X3D, VRML
- 🕵️ **Network Inspector** - Browse, filter, and flag every network request the page makes
- ⚡ **Real-time Monitoring** - Captures models as they load
- 💾 **One-Click Download** - Save files instantly with native browser dialog
- 🔒 **Privacy-First** - All processing happens locally in your browser
- 🎯 **Smart Filtering** - Format badges, confidence levels, size/type filters
- 📋 **URL Copying** - Grab model URLs for external tools

## 📦 Installation

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

#### Step 1: Download the Extension

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hoodini/3d-extracter.git
cd 3d-extracter
```

Or download the ZIP file and extract it.

#### Step 2: Generate PNG Icons

The extension includes an SVG icon template. You need to convert it to PNG format:

**Option A: Use the Built-in Generator (Easiest)**

1. Open `generate-icons.html` in Chrome
2. Click "Download All" button
3. Save the three PNG files (`icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`) in the `icons/` folder

**Option B: Use Command Line Tools**

```bash
# Using ImageMagick
convert -background none -resize 16x16 icons/icon.svg icons/icon16.png
convert -background none -resize 48x48 icons/icon.svg icons/icon48.png
convert -background none -resize 128x128 icons/icon.svg icons/icon128.png

# Using Inkscape
inkscape icons/icon.svg --export-filename=icons/icon16.png -w 16 -h 16
inkscape icons/icon.svg --export-filename=icons/icon48.png -w 48 -h 48
inkscape icons/icon.svg --export-filename=icons/icon128.png -w 128 -h 128
```

**Option C: Use Online Converters**

1. Visit [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png)
2. Upload `icons/icon.svg`
3. Convert to 16×16, 48×48, and 128×128 pixels
4. Save as `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, and `icon128.png` in `icons/` folder

> **Note:** The extension will work without PNG icons, but Chrome will show a warning.

#### Step 3: Load into Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `3d-extracter` folder
5. The extension icon should appear in your toolbar 🎉

## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Visit any website with 3D models**
   - Examples: 3D model generators, portfolio sites, WebGL demos, product viewers

2. **Wait for models to load**
   - The extension monitors network traffic automatically
   - A badge appears on the extension icon showing the count

3. **Click the extension icon → Models tab**
   - See every detected model with format badge and size
   - Each entry shows confidence: `high` (URL or content-type match), `low` (heuristic), `dom` (found in HTML), `manual` (you flagged it)

4. **Download or copy**
   - Click **⬇️ Download** to save the file
   - Click **📋 Copy URL** to copy the model URL
   - Use **🗑️ Clear Models** to reset the detected models

### Got a `.bin` file? Use 🔍 Identify

If a model is downloaded as `.bin` (or any unhelpful extension), click **🔍 Identify** on the model card. The extension fetches the first 8 KB of the file and inspects its **magic bytes** to determine the real format. If recognized, the model is renamed in place — the next download will save it with the correct extension (`.glb`, `.gltf`, `.fbx`, `.stl`, etc.).

Recognized signatures:

| Format | How we detect it |
|--------|------------------|
| **GLB** | First 4 bytes = `glTF` |
| **glTF JSON** | Starts with `{` and contains `"asset"` + `"buffers"`/`"meshes"`/`"version"` |
| **FBX Binary** | Starts with `Kaydara FBX Binary` |
| **3MF / USDZ / ZAE / `.blend`** | ZIP header (`PK\x03\x04`) + archive-content inspection |
| **STL ASCII** | Starts with `solid ` |
| **STL Binary** | 80-byte header + plausible triangle count |
| **PLY** | Starts with `ply\n` |
| **OBJ** | Multiple lines starting with `v `/`vn `/`vt `/`f `/`mtllib ` |
| **Collada (DAE)** | XML containing `COLLADA` |
| **X3D / VRML** | `<X3D` tag or `#VRML` header |
| **3DS** | Primary chunk magic `MM` (0x4D4D) |
| **Blender** | Starts with `BLENDER` |

#### Special case: glTF buffer files

When a website serves a `.gltf` (JSON) file, it usually references one or more `.bin` files for vertex/index/animation data. **Those `.bin` files are NOT standalone models** — they're useless without the parent `.gltf`. When Identify detects a raw binary buffer, the extension will:

1. Show a warning that the file is likely a glTF buffer
2. Search this tab's request log for a sibling `.gltf` in the same URL path
3. If found, offer a one-click "flag + download it" link to grab the parent

If no sibling is found, reload the page with the extension popup open so the request log captures both files.

### Convert GLB → STL / 3MF (for Bambu Lab Studio)

Every detected GLB shows two extra buttons next to Download: **→ STL** and **→ 3MF**. The extension does the conversion entirely in-browser — no upload, no external service. Output goes through Chrome's native "Save As" dialog.

**What it does**

- Parses the GLB header + JSON + BIN chunks
- Walks the scene graph applying every node's transform (TRS or matrix) into world space
- Decodes `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` primitives via a bundled Google DRACO WASM decoder (`lib/draco_decoder.wasm`)
- Writes binary STL or 3MF (uncompressed ZIP containing the model XML, content-types, and rels)
- Reports the final triangle count on the button

**Default transform**

Two toggles sit above the model list (both **on** by default):

- **Y-up → Z-up rotation** — rotates +90° around X so the model stands upright in slicers. glTF uses Y-up; Bambu Studio uses Z-up.
- **Scale ×1000 (m → mm)** — glTF distances are spec'd as meters; printer slicers work in millimeters.

Turn either off if your GLB was already authored Z-up or in millimeters.

**Limitations**

- **Self-contained `.glb` only.** External buffers (`.gltf` referencing `.bin` files) aren't fetched automatically — convert in Blender first.
- **Geometry only.** Materials, textures, vertex colors, morph targets, and skeletal animations are dropped — STL has no concept of materials anyway, and 3MF would need extension blocks beyond the core schema we emit.
- **Triangle primitives only.** Lines, points, quads, and triangle-strips are skipped.
- **No sparse accessors.**

If conversion fails, the error message will tell you which feature was hit. You can typically work around it by importing the GLB into Blender and re-exporting.

### Network Inspector (advanced)

When auto-detection misses a model — because it's served from a CDN with a generic URL, comes through as `application/octet-stream`, or is loaded via a custom protocol — switch to the **Network** tab.

- See every request the page made (capped at the last 600 per tab)
- Filter by URL/content-type text, resource type (XHR, Fetch, Image, Media, …), or minimum size
- Toggle **Flagged only** to see what the extension already detected
- Click any row to expand: shows full URL, method, content-type, size, status
- **🏷️ Flag as model** — promotes the request into the Models tab so you can download it
- **⬇️ Download** directly from the inspector even without flagging

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Broken Download Button
You generate a 3D model on a website, but the download button isn't working.
- ✅ Extension automatically captures the model URL
- ✅ Click download in the extension popup
- ✅ Save the file to your computer

#### Scenario 2: No Download Option
A website displays 3D models but doesn't provide any download functionality.
- ✅ Extension intercepts the GLB file as it loads
- ✅ Model appears in your detected list
- ✅ Download it with one click

#### Scenario 3: Multiple Models
A webpage loads several 3D models at once.
- ✅ Extension captures all of them
- ✅ Badge shows total count (e.g., "5")
- ✅ Download individually or copy all URLs

### Component Breakdown

#### 1. **Service Worker (background.js)**

The service worker runs in the background and intercepts all network requests using Chrome's `webRequest` API.

**Detection Logic:**
```javascript
// Each request is scored as model / not-model by:
1. URL extension whitelist
   .glb .gltf .m3f .3mf .fbx .obj .mtl .usdz .usdc .usd
   .stl .ply .dae .3ds .blend .x3d .vrml          → high confidence
2. Content-Type sniffing
   model/gltf-binary, model/gltf+json, model/3mf,
   model/vnd.collada+xml, model/vnd.usdz+zip,
   application/sla, application/vnd.autodesk.fbx   → high confidence
3. Heuristic — large binary (octet-stream, ≥ 50 KB) with a
   model-ish URL (/model/, /mesh/, /asset/, /3d/, /scene/,
   /avatar/)                                        → low confidence
4. Manual flag from the Network Inspector           → manual confidence
5. DOM scan in the content script                   → dom confidence
```

**What it does:**
- Listens to `onBeforeRequest`, `onHeadersReceived`, `onCompleted`, and `onErrorOccurred`
- Builds a per-tab request log (capped at 600 entries) for the Network Inspector
- Classifies each response using extension + content-type + size + URL keywords
- Extracts filename from URL path and appends the correct extension if missing
- Stores confirmed models in a Map indexed by tab ID
- Updates extension badge with model count
- Prevents duplicate entries for the same URL
- Resets per-tab state on top-level navigation only (subframe navigations preserved)

**Why a service worker?**
- Always running in the background
- Can intercept requests before they complete
- Persists across page reloads
- Low memory footprint

#### 2. **Content Script (content.js)**

Injected into every webpage to scan the DOM for model URLs that might not trigger network requests.

**Scanning Strategy:**
```javascript
// Searches every supported format in:
1. <script> tags containing absolute URLs
2. Data attributes (data-src, data-url, data-model, data-glb,
   data-gltf, data-asset, data-file, data-href, data-model-src)
3. <a href> and <iframe src> / <source src>
4. <model-viewer src>, <a-asset-item>, ios-src (USDZ AR)
5. Stylesheets — url() references in same-origin CSS rules
6. Dynamically loaded content (throttled MutationObserver, 60s)
```

**Advanced Features:**
- Uses MutationObserver to detect dynamically added content
- Searches page HTML with regex patterns
- Auto-disconnects after 30 seconds to avoid performance impact
- Sends found models to background script

**Why scan the DOM?**
- Some models are embedded as data URIs
- Blob URLs might not trigger network events
- Pre-loaded model URLs in JavaScript
- Static links that haven't been clicked yet

#### 3. **Popup Interface (popup.html + popup.js)**

The user interface that displays when clicking the extension icon.

**Features:**
- Two tabs: **Models** (auto-detected) and **Network** (every request)
- Network tab supports text search, resource-type filter, minimum size filter, and a "flagged only" toggle
- Click any network row to expand full details and flag/download
- Format badges color-coded per format (GLB blue, FBX amber, USDZ red, …)
- Confidence badges (low / dom / manual) make it obvious why something was flagged
- Auto-refreshes every 1.5 seconds while open
- Shows empty state when no models detected
- Formats file sizes (B → KB → MB → GB)
- Truncates long URLs for readability
- Uses secure DOM methods (textContent + createElement) to prevent XSS

**Download Flow:**
```javascript
User clicks Download
    ↓
popup.js sends message to background.js
    ↓
background.js calls chrome.downloads.download()
    ↓
Chrome shows "Save As" dialog
    ↓
File saved to user's chosen location
```

### Security Measures

- ✅ **No innerHTML** - Uses textContent and createElement to prevent XSS attacks
- ✅ **Content Security Policy** - Manifest v3 default protections
- ✅ **Local Processing** - No external servers or tracking
- ✅ **User Control** - Native "Save As" dialog for downloads
- ✅ **Permission Scoping** - Only requests necessary permissions

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### No models detected?

**Possible causes:**
- Models haven't loaded yet - wait a few seconds
- Website uses encrypted or authenticated downloads
- Models are embedded as base64 data URIs (not detectable)
- Website uses WebAssembly to decode proprietary formats

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page with extension enabled
2. Check DevTools Network tab for GLB/GLTF requests
3. Try right-clicking on the 3D viewer and inspect element
4. Some sites encrypt their models - this extension can't bypass DRM

### Download button fails?

**Possible causes:**
- Model URL requires authentication cookies
- CORS restrictions prevent download
- URL has expired or is no longer valid
- File is too large (over 2GB)

**Solutions:**
1. Use "Copy URL" and download with `curl` or `wget`:
   ```bash
   curl -O "https://example.com/model.glb"
   ```
2. Try opening the URL in a new tab
3. Use a download manager with authentication support

### Badge not showing count?

**Possible causes:**
- Extension needs to be reloaded
- JavaScript error in background script
- Chrome extension API rate limiting

**Solutions:**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "3D Model Extractor"
3. Click the refresh icon 🔄
4. Open DevTools for the extension and check for errors

### Extension not loading?

**Possible causes:**
- Missing PNG icons
- Invalid manifest.json syntax
- Chrome version too old

**Solutions:**
1. Check Chrome version (needs 88+)
2. Generate PNG icons using `generate-icons.html`
3. Check for errors in `chrome://extensions/`
