# versions (>= 4.3 since that's our minimum). Set to "4.4" (or higher) for

# dispatch with a structured error on older engines.

# ── Async tools (network downloads, long-running jobs) ─────────────────────
# Most tools are synchronous: execute() does the work and returns the final
# result in one editor tick. A few (e.g. asset downloads) must NOT block the
# editor's main thread for seconds, so they run their slow work on a worker
# Thread and report completion across editor ticks.
#
# Protocol:
#   1. execute() kicks off the background work and returns a Dictionary that
#      includes "async_pending": true (alongside "success": true). The bridge
#      does NOT treat that return as the final answer or send it to the client.
#   2. The bridge calls poll() once per editor tick. While the job is still
#      running, poll() returns {} (empty). When finished, poll() returns the
#      final result Dictionary (with a "success" key) — that becomes the single
#      response sent to the client.
#
# A synchronous tool never sets "async_pending" and never has poll() called,
# so this base implementation (always-empty) is safe to inherit untouched.
func poll() -> Dictionary:
	return {}


# Per-tool override for the bridge's async hard ceiling, in milliseconds.
# 0 (the default) means "use the bridge's ASYNC_DISPATCH_TIMEOUT_MSEC", which
# is sized for asset downloads. A tool whose work is legitimately longer —
# export_project builds can run minutes on a large project — sets this in
# execute() so the bridge does not abandon it mid-job. Set it from a
# caller-supplied bound rather than hardcoding something unbounded: the point
# is a HONEST ceiling, not the absence of one.
var async_timeout_msec: int = 0


# Called by the bridge when it gives up on an async dispatch (the tool blew
# its ceiling). Gives the tool a chance to release resources it owns —
# principally to kill a subprocess so a timed-out job does not leave an orphan
# running. Default no-op: a tool with nothing to clean up inherits it safely.
