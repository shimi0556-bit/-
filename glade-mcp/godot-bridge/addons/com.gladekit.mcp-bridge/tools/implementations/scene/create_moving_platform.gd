# Builds a MOVING PLATFORM (or sends an existing node patrolling a route) in ONE
# call, in EITHER 2D or 3D: a Path node holding the waypoint curve, a rider that
# travels it at constant speed, and a small PathMover logic-node that drives the
# rider. By default the rider is a freshly scaffolded AnimatableBody (collision +
# visible placeholder) that CARRIES a CharacterBody player; pass `target_path`
# instead to send an existing node (an enemy, a hazard) patrolling the same route.
#
# Dimension is inferred from the open scene's root (Node2D → 2D, Node3D → 3D);
# pass `space` ("2d" | "3d") to override. 2D builds Path2D + AnimatableBody2D +
# a Polygon2D placeholder; 3D builds Path3D + AnimatableBody3D + a BoxMesh
# placeholder.
#
# Why a PathMover that sets the rider's OWN global_position (rather than parenting
# the rider under a moving PathFollow node): an AnimatableBody only reports its
# platform velocity to a resting CharacterBody when its OWN transform changes —
# the same reason the engine's carrying-platform recipe animates the body's
# position directly. Moving a parent node leaves the body's own transform
# constant, so move_and_slide sees no platform velocity and the player is left
# behind (the classic "platform slides out from under the player, who floats in
# the air" bug). Driving the rider's own global_position fixes that and, as a
# bonus, never needs to own the rider's script (so a patrolling enemy keeps its
# own).
#
# Hand-rolled moving platforms are reliably buggy: a StaticBody the player slides
# off instead of riding, a _process mover physics never sees, or a home-grown
# lerp that stutters at the seams. This tool sidesteps all three: AnimatableBody
# (sync_to_physics) for the carry, a vetted mover that runs in _physics_process,
# and Godot's own baked curve for smooth interpolation. loop_mode covers the
# three real cases — "loop" (wrap around), "pingpong" (back and forth), "once"
# (travel then stop).
#
# Args:
#   space:       "2d" | "3d". Default: inferred from the open scene's root.
#   name:        Path node name. Default "MovingPlatform".
#   parent_path: scene-relative parent. Default: the scene root.
#   position:    placement of the Path node (waypoints are relative to it).
#                "x,y" in 2D, "x,y,z" in 3D. Default: 2D origin; 3D lifts to
#                y=2 so a bare "jump onto" platform clears a y=0 floor instead
#                of spawning inside it. Pass an explicit position to override.
#   points:      the route, as waypoints relative to `position`. Accepts
#                [[x,y(,z)], ...], ["x,y(,z)", ...], or a single
#                "x,y(,z);x,y(,z)" string. The first point is the start.
#                Default: a short horizontal sweep so a bare call still moves
#                (2D: 0,0 → 200,0; 3D: 0,0,0 → 4,0,0).
#   speed:       distance per second along the curve (pixels in 2D, metres in
#                3D). Default 80 (2D) / 3 (3D).
#   loop_mode:   "loop" | "pingpong" | "once". Default "loop".
#   wait_time:   seconds to pause at each end (pingpong/once). Default 0.
#   size:        scaffolded platform body size. "w,h" in 2D (default "96,16"),
#                "w,h,d" in 3D (default "2,0.5,2"). Ignored when target_path is
#                given.
#   one_way:     2D only — make the scaffolded platform ONE-WAY (land on top,
#                jump up through from below). Default false. Ignored in 3D and
#                when target_path is given.
#   color:       placeholder fill color for the scaffolded platform.
#   target_path: scene-relative path to an EXISTING node to send along the route
#                instead of scaffolding a platform (Node2D in 2D, Node3D in 3D).
#                Its script is left intact (the PathMover drives its position).
#   directory:   res:// folder for the generated mover script.
#                Default "res://scripts".
#   overwrite:   regenerate the shared mover script if it exists. Default false.
#
# Response payload:
#   created_script, path (Path node path), mover (PathMover node path),
#   rider (the platform/target node path), space, loop_mode, point_count
