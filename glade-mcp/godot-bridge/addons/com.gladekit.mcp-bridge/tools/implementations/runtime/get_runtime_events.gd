# Returns structured runtime errors captured since the caller's cursor.
# Read-only. Designed for incremental polling — the agent passes the previous
# response's `next_cursor` on subsequent calls to receive only new events.
#
# Errors are parsed out of active PlaySessionManager subprocess stderr feeds
# by RuntimeLogStream. Captured prefixes: ERROR, SCRIPT ERROR, USER SCRIPT
# ERROR (Godot 4.x error format). WARNING and plain stdout are intentionally
# dropped — this stream is errors-only, matching the Unity bridge's behavior.
#
# Mirrors Unity's get_runtime_events. The shape difference vs that tool:
# Godot's `log_type` enum is {ERROR, SCRIPT_ERROR, USER_SCRIPT_ERROR}
# rather than {Error, Exception} because Godot doesn't distinguish them at
# the stderr layer.
#
# Args:
#   since_cursor: int — return events with cursor > this value. Default 0
#                       (returns everything currently in the ring buffer).
#   limit:        int — max events per call. Default 200, hard-capped 2000.
#                       Events past the limit remain for the next poll.
#   wait_ms:      int — optional blocking wait (max 5000) for new events to
#                       arrive. The tool re-drains active session pipes every
#                       100ms until events appear OR the deadline passes,
#                       then returns. Use this right after run_project so
#                       the first poll doesn't beat the subprocess to _ready.
#                       Default 0 (return immediately, no wait).
#
# Response payload:
#   events:                  [Dict] each {cursor, message, stack_trace,
#                                          log_type, timestamp, fingerprint}
#   next_cursor:             int  — pass this on the next poll
#   play_mode_active:        bool — true if any PlaySessionManager session is running
#   observation_active:      bool
#   ring_buffer_size:        int  — current ring size (informational)
#   dropped_due_to_overflow: int  — total evicted by buffer overflow this session
#   total_events_observed:   int  — total ever ingested since editor start
#   raw_stderr_bytes:        int  — diagnostic: total bytes captured from
#                                    subprocess stderr (across active sessions).
#                                    Empty events + raw_stderr_bytes>0 → parser
#                                    missed a prefix. Empty events + 0 bytes →
#                                    subprocess didn't write to stderr (libc
#                                    buffering, no errors fired, or pipe issue).
#   raw_stdout_bytes:        int  — same for stdout (print() output etc.).
#   raw_stderr_tail:         String — last ~500 chars of stderr from the
#                                      largest session, for debugging unknown
#                                      prefixes.
#
# Composability: this tool pumps active session pipes before reading the ring,
# but does NOT consume the user-facing stdout/stderr buffer that
# get_debug_output reads from. The two tools are independent — agents can use
# them in either order, on the same session, without interference.
