# Read-only mode: when active, the bridge refuses every tool whose name is
# NOT in READ_ONLY_TOOLS. Used for "show me the project but don't change it"
# sessions (audit, inspection, code review, demos).
#
# Toggle via ProjectSettings (per-project, persists in project.godot):
#   gladekit/read_only_mode = true
# or via OS env override (per-process, no persistence):
#   GLADEKIT_GODOT_READ_ONLY=1
#
# Mirrors the Unity bridge's READ_ONLY_TOOLS constant. New read-only tools
# must be added here AND have requires_edit_mode=false on the tool itself.
#
# Read-only contract — bridge definition:
#   This list defines read-only as "the tool does not mutate the user's
#   project files / scene tree / resources." Tools that flip bridge-only
#   state (start_runtime_observation, stop_runtime_observation) ARE listed
#   here because they don't touch the project.
#
#   Downstream consumers may choose a stricter rule — a UI client or
#   orchestrator that wants "absolutely nothing changes" semantics is free
#   to maintain its own narrower allowlist that excludes the bridge-state
#   toggles. The bridge intentionally takes the looser stance (no project
#   mutation = read) so audit / inspection sessions can still arm and
#   disarm runtime observation.

# Typed Array[String] literal (a constant expression) rather than a
# PackedStringArray(...) constructor (which is NOT const-evaluable in GDScript).
