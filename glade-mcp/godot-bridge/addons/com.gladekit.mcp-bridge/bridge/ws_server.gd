# WebSocket server for the GladeKit MCP Bridge.
#
# Architecture: a background Thread owns the WebSocket I/O loop (TCPServer
# accept, WebSocketPeer.poll, send_text). This decouples the bridge from the
# editor's frame loop, which is critical because Godot's editor aggressively
# throttles its main loop when unfocused (~20Hz via
# unfocused_low_processor_mode_sleep_usec) — gating p99 latency at ~100ms+.
# An editor plugin can't reliably override the editor's focus-aware throttle.
# Running our own thread sidesteps the issue.
#
# Why WebSocket instead of HTTP:
#   Godot has no built-in HTTP server primitive. WebSocketPeer + TCPServer
#   give us a battle-tested, RFC-compliant transport without rolling an
#   HTTP/1.1 parser in GDScript.
#
# Endpoint thread-safety:
#   - "health" + "tools/list": pure metadata, answered directly by the
#     thread. Fast regardless of editor focus.
#   - "tools/execute": tools touch the editor's scene tree, which is
#     main-thread-only. We marshal across via a Mutex-protected queue.
#     Main-thread dispatch is still editor-tick-bound, but tool work
#     naturally dominates the wall clock anyway.
#
# Wire protocol (newline-free JSON text frames):
#
#   REQUEST:
#     { "id": "req-1",
#       "endpoint": "health" | "tools/list" | "tools/execute",
#       "toolName":  "...",   // for tools/execute
#       "arguments": "..." | {...}  // JSON string or dict, for tools/execute
#     }
#
#   RESPONSE (success):
#     { "id": "req-1", "success": true, "message": "...", ...payload }
#
#   RESPONSE (error):
#     { "id": "req-1", "success": false, "error": "...", "message": "..." }
#
# The 'id' field is echoed verbatim so async clients can correlate.

# VERSION is read dynamically from plugin.cfg at startup — see _read_version().
# A hardcoded const here drifted in 0.3.1 -> 0.4.0 (smoke test caught it), so
# we make plugin.cfg the single source of truth for the on-the-wire version.

# Main-thread stall watchdog. tools/execute (and the other main-thread

# synchronous operation blocks the editor, queued dispatches would otherwise
# sit until every client rides out its own timeout with an opaque error —
# and every FOLLOW-UP call piles up behind them, so the whole bridge looks
# dead. The worker thread expires dispatches older than this and answers
# with a structured "editor main thread stalled" error that names the cause
# and how to clear it. Keep this below typical client per-call timeouts

# thread (a download that hangs). Set above the downloader's own 60s timeout so
# the tool's own error surfaces first; this is the backstop if the tool itself
# wedges. NOTE: pure-MCP clients typically use a ~30s per-call timeout, so an

# aggregates several of those. An oversized outbound frame makes send_text
# fail (client hangs to timeout); an oversized inbound frame (e.g.
