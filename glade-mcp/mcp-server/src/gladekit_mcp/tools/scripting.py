Hand-written third-person controllers reliably ship two runtime bugs the playability probe catches automatically: a self-referential camera offset that makes the player walk in circles, and a fragile collision-callback isGrounded that kills the jump. This tool is ATOMIC and does the whole setup for you: it copies two vetted, Play-tested scripts VERBATIM (ThirdPersonController.cs — CharacterController movement + grounded jump, camera-relative input; FollowCamera.cs — modern mouse/right-stick orbit camera), ensures a Player capsule and a Main Camera exist, adds CharacterController to the Player, and attaches ThirdPersonController + FollowCamera automatically as soon as the scripts compile. After it returns, your ONLY remaining step is to call compile_scripts and wait for status='idle' — do NOT call add_component for the controller, the follow camera, or the character controller (the tool already handled all three), and no object-reference wiring is needed (the scripts self-resolve: ThirdPersonController → Camera.main, FollowCamera → the 'Player' tag). For a 2D SIDE-SCROLLING platformer player instead, use create_platformer_controller; for a TOP-DOWN 2D player, use create_top_down_controller (both separate vetted templates). Use create_script ONLY for other controllers with no template yet (twin-stick, vehicles). Do NOT use this when the request is only about physics or gravity on an existing object (e.g. 'make the Player fall with gravity', 'add physics to X') — add_rigidbody or add_component is the correct minimal answer. Scaffolding a controller, camera and capsule for a one-component request is over-engineering: the (a)+(b)+(c) trigger above is a conjunction, not a general 'player setup' cue.",
