"""
Bridge staleness warning for MCP server users.

The MCP bridge (com.gladekit.mcp-bridge) is installed via UPM git URL. Unity
caches it once on resolve and never refetches, so users drift backward over
time as new bridge features ship.

On startup and on first tool call, this module pings the bridge's
/api/health endpoint, reads the bridgeVersion field (added in bridge
v0.4.0), and compares against MIN_BRIDGE_VERSION. When stale, it:

  1. Logs a warning to stderr (visible in the MCP debug pane of Cursor /
     Claude Code / Windsurf).
  2. Returns a one-shot warning prefix that the call_tool handler prepends
     to the next tool response — so the warning surfaces in the chat where
     the user actually looks.

The prefix is suppressed after the first emission per process to avoid noise.
A bridge older than v0.4.0 returns no bridgeVersion field; we treat that as
stale by definition.
