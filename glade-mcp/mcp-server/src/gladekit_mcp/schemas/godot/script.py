"""
Godot GDScript tools — file CRUD + node attachment + vetted scaffolders (16 tools).

GDScript files are .gd resources living anywhere under res://. Each
Godot node can have at most one attached script (vs Unity's many
MonoBehaviour components). Use create_script + attach_script_to_node
to add behavior to a node; for built-in behaviors (physics, lights,
etc.) prefer create_node with the appropriate class instead.

modify_script enforces a session-aware safety gate: it refuses to
overwrite a .gd file the bridge did NOT create in the current Godot
session unless the caller passes confirm_existing_file_modification=true.
This protects user-authored code from accidental overwrites when the
agent misreads a "scaffold new" prompt as "extend existing".
