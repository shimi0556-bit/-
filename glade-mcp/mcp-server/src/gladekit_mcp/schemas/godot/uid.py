"""
Godot 4.4+ ResourceUID tools (2 tools).

Godot 4.4 introduced .uid sidecar files so resource references survive
renames and moves outside the editor. The bridge enforces a version gate:
on Godot 4.3 these tools return a structured "requires Godot 4.4+" error
rather than executing — call them anyway, the agent will see the
explanatory error and pivot.

Code adapted from Coding-Solo/godot-mcp (MIT, see addons/com.gladekit.mcp-bridge/NOTICE).
