"""
Godot project tools (4): introspection + input map setup + session recap.

`get_project_info` answers "what is this Godot project?" in a single
call — name, version, renderer, main scene, currently edited scene,
counts of scenes/scripts/resources, enabled addons, and (in detailed
mode) bounded file listings + the input map.

Designed to replace the 4-5 exploratory tool calls an agent typically
makes when dropped into an unknown project. Consolidates the kind of
discovery that competitor MCP servers expose as separate
list-scenes / list-scripts / get-project-version tools.

`list_assets` enumerates referenceable media. `get_session_summary` is the
Godot twin of the Unity tool of the same name — the bridge's own mutation
log, grouped by category, for "what did you just do?" questions. All three
are read-only and safe in play mode. `add_input_action` is the one mutating
tool here — it defines custom InputMap actions (WASD, jump, etc.) so
action-based input scripts have actions to reference.
