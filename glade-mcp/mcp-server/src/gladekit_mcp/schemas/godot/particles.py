"""
Godot particle / juice tools (3 tools).

Preset-driven GPUParticles2D / GPUParticles3D scaffolding. Particles are the
cheapest, highest-impact way to make a game feel alive (impacts, pickups, fire,
smoke, trails); the presets ship tuned ParticleProcessMaterial values so the
result looks intentional without hand-authoring ~15-25 fiddly properties. The 3D
variant additionally ships a billboarded draw pass so the effect is visible
immediately (a GPUParticles3D renders nothing without one).
