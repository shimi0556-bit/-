Godot signal tools (3 tools).

Signals are Godot's idiomatic event mechanism — a Button declares a
`pressed` signal, an Area3D declares `body_entered`, etc. Wiring a signal
to a method is how most interactivity gets built. The tools here cover
the editor-time, scene-saved (CONNECT_PERSIST) flavor of wiring — the
kind you'd otherwise create through the Godot editor's Node panel.

For runtime-only connections (made and broken during gameplay), the
agent should write GDScript using `signal.connect(...)` instead — that's
a code concern, not an editor wiring concern.

Three tools, intentionally consolidated:

  connect_signal           — wire emitter.signal -> target.method
                             (persistent, scene-saved)
  list_signal_connections  — read existing wiring; also lists declared
                             signals via response_format="detailed"
  disconnect_signal        — remove a persistent connection

The standalone "list signals on a node" use case is folded into
list_signal_connections with response_format="detailed" — the agent
almost never wants signals without also wanting connection state, and
exposing them as separate tools just makes the agent choose between
two read endpoints that should have been one.
