"""
Godot tool schemas organized by category.

Mirrors the Unity-side `tools/` package shape. The schema names + arg
shapes here MUST stay in lockstep with the canonical Godot bridge tool
registry; the bridge registers tools by name and the schemas describe
them to the AI client. A parity test in `tests/test_registry_godot.py`
asserts every registered bridge tool has a schema and vice versa.

Categories follow the Godot bridge's own directory layout under
`addons/com.gladekit.mcp-bridge/tools/implementations/`:

    scene     — Node creation (incl. 2D sprites / tilemaps +
                collision), queries, transforms, resource assign (18 tools)
    script    — GDScript file CRUD + node attachment + vetted
                scaffolders (3D/2D controllers, screen shake)    ( 8 tools)
    camera    — Camera (2D/3D) + Light (2D/3D) + WorldEnv       ( 6 tools)
    resource  — Material creation, generic Resource creation,
                property updates                                ( 3 tools)
    physics   — PhysicsBody (2D/3D) + auto-collision-shape      ( 1 tool)
    particles — GPUParticles2D/3D presets + property tuning     ( 3 tools)
    scene_io  — .tscn create/open/save/instantiate              ( 4 tools)
    runtime   — Play-mode + selection + console + play session
                + structured runtime-event observation          (10 tools)
    uid       — Godot 4.4+ ResourceUID handling                 ( 2 tools)
    signal    — Persistent (scene-saved) signal wiring          ( 3 tools)
    project   — Introspection + asset listing + input actions
                + session mutation-log recap                    ( 4 tools)
    ui        — Control-tree creation + anchor / text helpers   ( 6 tools)
    animation — AnimationPlayer + AnimationTree state machines  ( 9 tools)
    asset_pipeline — find / import / audit external CC0 assets   ( 3 tools)
    audio     — AudioStreamPlayer (2D/3D) create + mutate        ( 2 tools)
    navigation — 3D navmesh bake + NavigationAgent3D             ( 2 tools)
                                                                ───────
                                                                81 tools

(Per-category counts are indicative; the authoritative catalog size is
asserted against the bridge registry by the parity test in
tests/test_registry_godot.py.)

Unlike the Unity side (~235 tools across 17 categories) we expose the
full Godot catalog directly — it is well within Claude Code's ~128-tool
budget so there's no need for a CORE_TOOLS filter.

Note: find_asset (in asset_pipeline) is answered by the server itself rather
than dispatched to the bridge, so it appears here but has no bridge tool.

# ── Read-only tool set ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Tools that only query the project / editor and never mutate it. The MCP
# layer stamps these with a `readOnlyHint` annotation so clients (Claude Code,
# Cursor, …) can auto-approve them without a per-call confirmation prompt.
#
# This MUST stay in lockstep with the bridge's authoritative list at
#   godot-bridge/addons/com.gladekit.mcp-bridge/services/read_only_guard.gd
# (the `READ_ONLY_TOOLS` const). A parity test in tests/test_registry_godot.py
# parses that file and asserts the two sets are identical, so drift in either
# direction surfaces as a failing test rather than a silently wrong annotation.
#
# Note: run_project / stop_project / launch_editor are NOT here — they are
# safe to call in play mode (requires_edit_mode = false) but they DO have
# side effects (spawn/kill a game process, focus the editor), so they are not
# read-only.
