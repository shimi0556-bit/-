Godot animation tools (11 tools) — AnimationPlayer + Animation .tres
scaffolding, plus AnimationTree state machines and 1D/2D blend spaces.

The AnimationPlayer node itself + the Animation .tres are created via
existing tools — `create_node(type='AnimationPlayer', parent_path='...')`
and `create_resource(type='Animation', path='res://anim/jump.tres')`.
The first five tools close the gap between "I have an empty player + an
empty animation" and "I have a playable animation library."

  add_animation_to_player    register an Animation .tres with a player
                             under a library + name (default library is
                             "", the conventional default).
  add_animation_track        add a track to an Animation: value (any
                             property), position_3d / rotation_3d /
                             scale_3d (Node3D transform), or method
                             (calls a function at keyframes).
  add_animation_keyframe     insert a keyframe at time T with value V.
                             Value parsing dispatches on track type.
  set_animation_properties   length / loop_mode / step on the Animation.
  get_animation_player_info  read-only: libraries + animations + state.

The last four wrap those clips into an AnimationNodeStateMachine — a
state machine of states + transitions, so a character blends
idle/walk/run/jump driven by travel() or advance conditions.

  create_animation_tree         AnimationTree + state machine bound to a
                                player (seeds one state per clip by
                                default).
  add_state_machine_state       add a state that plays one clip.
  add_state_machine_transition  connect two states (Start/End, switch
                                mode, cross-fade, advance condition).
  get_animation_tree_info       read-only: states + transitions, OR
                                blend-space points + bounds, + binding.

create_blend_space_2d is the directional counterpart: an AnimationTree
rooted in an AnimationNodeBlendSpace2D that picks/blends a character's
per-facing clips from a single 2D vector (feed velocity.normalized()
into parameters/blend_position).

  create_blend_space_2d         AnimationTree + 2D blend space bound to a
                                player (auto-seeds from up/down/left/right
                                clip names).
  create_blend_space_1d         AnimationTree + 1D blend space bound to a
                                player (auto-seeds idle/walk/run by a single
                                speed scalar).

Composition flow for a typical scaffold (e.g., "add a 0.6s jump
animation on Player"):

    create_node(type='AnimationPlayer', parent_path='Player')
        -> AnimationPlayer node child
    create_resource(type='Animation', path='res://anim/jump.tres')
        -> empty Animation .tres
    add_animation_to_player(player_path='Player/AnimationPlayer',
                            animation_path='res://anim/jump.tres',
                            animation_name='jump')
    add_animation_track(animation_path='res://anim/jump.tres',
                        track_type='position_3d', node_path='..')
        -> track_index=0
    add_animation_keyframe(animation_path='res://anim/jump.tres',
                           track_index=0, time=0.0, value='0,0,0')
    add_animation_keyframe(animation_path='res://anim/jump.tres',
                           track_index=0, time=0.3, value='0,2,0')
    add_animation_keyframe(animation_path='res://anim/jump.tres',
                           track_index=0, time=0.6, value='0,0,0')
    set_animation_properties(animation_path='res://anim/jump.tres',
                             length=0.6, loop_mode='none')

The track's node_path is resolved relative to the AnimationPlayer's
`root_node` property (default ".."  — the player's parent). Use
get_animation_player_info to inspect the current root_node when
authoring tracks against a non-default setup.
