"""
Godot bridge staleness warning for MCP server users.

The Godot bridge (com.gladekit.mcp-bridge) is installed via UPM git URL.
Godot caches it once on resolve and never refetches, so users drift
backward over time as new bridge features ship.

On startup and on first tool call, this module pings the bridge's
`health` WS endpoint, reads the `bridgeVersion` field, and compares
against MIN_GODOT_BRIDGE_VERSION. When stale, it:

  1. Logs a warning to stderr (visible in the MCP debug pane of Cursor /
     Claude Code / Windsurf).
  2. Returns a one-shot warning prefix that the call_tool handler prepends
     to the next tool response — so the warning surfaces in chat where
     the user actually looks.

The prefix is suppressed after the first emission per process to avoid noise.

Mirrors `bridge_version.py` (Unity) with two key differences:
  - Probes the Godot WS bridge instead of the Unity HTTP bridge.
  - Uses its own `_prefix_emitted` / `_startup_check_done` flags so the
    Godot and Unity warnings don't clobber each other when both bridges
    happen to be running.
