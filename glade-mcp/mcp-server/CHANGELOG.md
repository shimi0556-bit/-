# Changelog

All notable changes to `gladekit-mcp` are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **HTTP transport default port is now `8767` (was `8766`).** `8766` is the Godot bridge's port, so `gladekit-mcp --transport http` could not bind while a Godot editor was open. stdio, the default transport, is unaffected. Existing HTTP clients pointing at `http://127.0.0.1:8766/mcp` should update the URL or pass `--port 8766` explicitly.
- **Meta-tools on Godot.** `batch_execute`, `get_relevant_tools`, `remember_for_session`, and `recall_session_memories` are now exposed in Godot sessions; they were Unity-only. `batch_execute` runs the calls sequentially over the Godot WebSocket bridge and reports per-call results. `get_relevant_tools` groups Godot tools by category with Godot-specific keyword routing, and on the paid tier it is now the way a Godot session reaches the engine-aware knowledge base from an MCP client — the retrieval shipped in 0.7.15 was unreachable there without it. `search_project_scripts` remains Unity-only: the Godot bridge does not yet return script contents in one call.

### Fixed

- **The Godot release zip now carries the license and third-party NOTICE.** `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` (MIT attribution for the `godot-mcp` UID code) now live inside `addons/com.gladekit.mcp-bridge/`, so the packaged addon ships them; previously they sat outside the zipped folder.
- **Unity package `changelogUrl` pointed at a 404.** It now points at `mcp-server/CHANGELOG.md`, where this file lives.
- README refreshed against the code: 275 Unity / 115 Godot tools, ~90 core tools, 9 resources; the Godot bridge source path, Architecture, and Contributing now cover both bridges; the comparison table was re-verified against current competitor sources.

## [0.7.23] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- **Unity can ship a game — `get_build_info`, `set_build_scenes`, `build_player`, `get_build_status` (271 → 275 tools).** Godot could produce a distributable build; Unity could not, so the last step of every project fell outside the tool set. Unity forces one structural difference from the Godot export path: `BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer` is synchronous, runs on the editor main thread, has no async variant, and cannot be pushed into a subprocess because Unity refuses to open a project in a second instance. The editor is frozen for the whole build, so a blocking call would outlive the MCP client's ~30s timeout on any real project — the client gives up, the build still finishes, and nothing can report the outcome. `build_player` therefore validates, schedules on the next editor tick, and answers immediately; `get_build_status` reports the result afterwards from `SessionState`, which survives the domain reload a target-platform recompile triggers.

- **Godot bridge addon v0.7.11 — `set_node_transform_batch` (110 → 111 tools).** Moves, rotates or scales many nodes in one call, with per-node values. Godot previously had no arbitrary batch path: `arrange_nodes` covers regular row/column/grid layouts from a single anchor, but anything else — explicit positions, rotations, mixed changes — meant one `set_node_transform` call per node, and laying out a few dozen props that way is slow and expensive enough to dominate a request. `set_node_transform` now points at the batch variant for two or more nodes, and both tools share one implementation, so the single and batch paths cannot drift apart. Partial failures are reported per node rather than collapsed into one result.

### Fixed

- **A scene deleted from disk no longer costs a failed build to discover.** Unity's Build Settings keeps pointing at scenes after they are deleted, and `BuildPlayer`'s error blames the path *format* — "is an incorrect path for a scene file … expects paths relative to the project folder" — when the path is well-formed and the file is simply gone. An agent reading that will rewrite an already-correct path repeatedly. `get_build_info` now reports missing scenes as a blocker and `build_player` catches them pre-flight, replacing an 11-second failed build with an accurate sentence.

- **A build interrupted by a domain reload no longer strands every later build.** The scheduled build callback does not survive a reload but the `SessionState` flag does, so `get_build_status` reported a phantom build still running and every subsequent `build_player` refused to start with "already in progress". An `[InitializeOnLoadMethod]` now reconciles the stranded state to failed/Interrupted on load.

- **`build_player` refuses an `outputPath` inside `Assets/`**, which would make Unity import the entire built player back into the project as assets.

- Cleared three compiler warnings in the bridge's own code — two obsolete `ShaderUtil` statics in `SetMaterialPropertyTool` (the same file already used the modern `Shader.GetPropertyCount` / `GetPropertyName` a few lines below, so the two halves disagreed) and a write-only local in `UnityBridgeServer`.

## [0.7.22] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- **Scaffolding a controller now reuses what is already there instead of duplicating it.** `create_third_person_controller` treated every invocation as a fresh setup, so running it on a scene that already had a player produced a second capsule, a second camera and a second set of scripts. It now detects the existing objects and wires those, and the whole scaffold is registered as a single undoable step so one Undo reverts the turn rather than leaving half the objects behind.

- **`create_third_person_controller` no longer fires on physics-only requests.** Its selection guidance read as a general "player setup" cue, so asking to make an existing object fall with gravity could scaffold an entire controller, camera and capsule. The description now states the movement + jump + follow-camera trigger is a conjunction and points physics-only requests at `add_rigidbody` / `add_component`.

### Changed

- **The batch scene tools are now reachable.** `destroy_gameobjects_batch` and `set_transform_batch` existed but described themselves so tersely that the model almost never chose them over repeating the single-object call. Production turns were spending 48–56 sequential round-trips laying out objects one at a time where one batch call would do. Their descriptions — and `set_transform`'s, which now points at the batch variant — say plainly when to prefer batching. Measured tool selection on the relevant eval cases went from 1/4 to 4/4.

- Refreshed the bundled Kenney asset catalog.

## [0.7.21] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **Works with MCP SDK 2.x, and no longer installs an SDK it cannot run.** The `mcp[cli]` requirement was open-ended (`>=1.0`), so once SDK 2.0 was released every fresh install pulled it in — and 2.0 removed the `@server.list_tools()` / `@server.call_tool()` decorators this server registered its handlers with. The result was a startup failure reading `AttributeError: 'Server' object has no attribute 'list_tools'`, with nothing pointing at the cause.

  The server now supports **both** SDK generations. Handlers are bound to whichever one is importable, so `gladekit-mcp` works whether the host application supplies a 1.x or a 2.x SDK. Behaviour is identical across the two: the same resource content types, the same validation of tool arguments against the advertised `inputSchema`, and the same conversion of a tool error into a readable result rather than a transport failure.

  The supported range is now `mcp[cli]>=1.10,<3`, and every edge of it — the floor, the newest 1.x, the newest 2.x — is exercised by the test suite. The floor rose from the nominal `>=1.0` because 1.10 is the first release with the DNS-rebinding protection the HTTP transport enables and the content types the tools return; earlier versions could not have run. Optional refinements no longer constrain it: the HTTP transport's idle-session timeout (added in SDK 1.27) is applied when the installed SDK supports it and skipped when it does not, rather than making an opt-in transport's tuning knob decide whether the package installs at all.

### Changed

- **Per-client session state is now keyed to the connection rather than the SDK's session object.** Facts stored with `remember_for_session`, along with telemetry and skill calibration, are scoped per connection. SDK 2.x builds a new session object for every request, so the previous key changed mid-conversation and nothing stored was ever recalled. The new key is stable for the life of a connection, distinct between concurrent clients, and no longer derived from an object address — which could be reused after a client disconnected and leak one session's notes into the next.

## [0.7.20] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- **Godot bridge addon v0.7.10 — `check_script_errors`.** GDScript has no build step, but it has a parser and a type analyser, and a script failing either is dead at load time — and nothing reported it: a broken write returned success, `recent_errors` only tracked tool errors, and the editor log stayed empty, so the model only learned something was wrong when the scene refused to start, with no file or line. `check_script_errors` is a read-only tool that runs the engine's own parser (`--headless --check-only`, ~0.2s) and reports each problem with file and line — static type violations and calls to functions that do not exist, not just syntax.
- **Retrieval at scale for large projects.** Both bridges now emit a per-script mtime during context gather (Unity: ISO-8601 string, Godot: Unix epoch int), so script embeddings are refreshed only for files that changed rather than wholesale each session, and un-narrowable queries ("fix the bug") fall back to a bounded candidate set — recently edited and entry-point/manager scripts — instead of embedding the entire project.
- **Project-dimension signal.** The Unity context gatherer reports the main camera's projection so a client can infer once per turn whether the project is a 2D or 3D game instead of re-deriving it from whatever scene happens to be open.

### Fixed

- **Godot `modify_script` no longer erases a script and reports success.** The full-rewrite path gated on key *presence* (`args.has("content")`) while Unity gates on the *value*; a model emitting `content: null` therefore wrote an empty file and got `{"success": true, "bytes": 0}` back (reproduced live: 145 chars → 0). `modify_script` and `create_script` now gate on the value, with a final pre-write check that also catches a surgical edit whose `old_string` spans the whole file.

## [0.7.19] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **`create_top_down_controller` (Unity)** completes the vetted controller trio (3D third-person, 2D side-scroller, 2D top-down). Hand-written top-down controllers reliably ship unnormalized diagonals (~1.41x faster) and a forgotten `gravityScale` (the player slides off-screen); the `TopDownController2D` template fixes both, and `Camera2DFollow` ships by default because a top-down player leaves a static frame in seconds. Atomic scene assembly with deferred wiring, NUnit-tested.
- **Godot bridge addon v0.7.9 — outline mode on `get_script_content`.** `outline=true` returns `{kind, name, line, signature}` per declaration (`class_name`, inner classes, `func` including static, `signal`, `enum`, `const`, `@export` / `@onready` vars) instead of the file body, so the agent maps a large script cheaply and then reads only the member it needs. Not a mechanical port of the C# brace-depth machine: GDScript is indentation-scoped, so `gdscript_outline.gd` tracks block context by indent.

## [0.7.18] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Play-verify heal gate for Unity — runtime parity with Godot's play-verify.** Godot already withheld "done" after a gameplay build until the game ran clean; Unity had only the compile and still-frame gates, so a `NullReferenceException` in `Awake` / `Start` / `Update` compiled fine and shipped silently. `start_playability_probe` / `get_playability_probe_result` now carry the runtime layer: after a gameplay build the loop forces a probe, reads the result, and heals (up to three attempts) or escalates. `ProbeDriver` gained the runtime-error capture this needs.

## [0.7.17] - 2026-07-20

### Security

- **Godot bridge addon v0.7.8 — per-session token authentication (closes a cross-site WebSocket drive-by).** The Godot bridge is a WebSocket server on `127.0.0.1:8766`, and any web page the user visits can open `new WebSocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8766")` and drive every write tool — including `run_project`, which spawns a subprocess. Godot 4's `accept_stream` does not expose the handshake to GDScript, so the bridge can inspect neither `Origin` nor a custom header; the only defense is a secret a browser cannot obtain. On startup the bridge now generates a random token, publishes it to `<home>/.gladekit/godot-bridge-<port>.token` (owner-only on Unix), and refuses every request except `health` that does not echo it. This server reads the file and sends the token automatically. `GLADEKIT_GODOT_NO_AUTH=1` opts out for older clients, logged loudly.
- **Unity bridge — path-traversal hardening on the raw file-op endpoints.** `/api/turn/revert` and `/api/file/backup` did raw `File.Delete` / `File.Copy` on wire-supplied `filePath` / `backupPath` with no containment check, so an unauthenticated local process could delete or overwrite any file the editor can write. Wire-supplied paths are now resolved and rejected unless they stay inside the project root; `ToolUtils` carries the shared guard and the async tool path gained the same check.

## [0.7.16] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Surgical script editing for large existing files (both engines).** `get_script_content` reads a line range (`startLine` / `endLine`, with `totalLines` and a `partial` flag) so the agent can pull one method out of a huge file; `modify_script` gained an anchor-edit mode (`oldString` / `newString`, `replaceAll` — a non-unique anchor is rejected, an empty replacement deletes) alongside the full-file rewrite; and `find_references` keeps scanning past `max_files` so the reported project-wide total is true rather than truncated.
- **Accurate `find_references` and new `rename_symbol` via a lexical scanner (both engines).** A dependency-free scanner classifies every character as code or comment/string (C#: interpolated-string holes are seen, literal text is not; GDScript: `#` comments and single-, double-, and triple-quoted strings, including multi-line docstrings), so matching and renaming touch whole identifiers in code regions only — searching `Player` never matches `PlayerController`, and `health` never hits `health_max`.
- **`get_script_content` outline mode (Unity).** `outline=true` returns an ordered list of `{kind, name, line, signature}` for a C# file's types and members, recognised only at type-body brace depth so a call inside a body is never mistaken for a declaration.
- **`create_save_system` (both engines).** A one-call, vetted save/load system: Unity writes a `SaveSystem` MonoBehaviour persisting a typed key/value store as JSON to `Application.persistentDataPath` (not `PlayerPrefs`); Godot writes a `SaveManager` autoload persisting to `user://`. Both support multiple slots, autosave on quit, tolerate a missing or corrupt file, and reuse rather than clobber an existing script.
- **`create_platformer_controller` (Unity) and `dimension` on `create_collectible` / `create_hazard`.** The 2D gameplay layer: a Rigidbody2D run-and-jump player (grounded via a feet overlap, rotation frozen, new-Input-System bindings) assembled with sprite, collider, orthographic camera, and optional ground; `dimension: "2d"` builds 2D trigger variants of the collectible and hazard. Errors on a 2D/3D physics mix.
- **Godot bridge addon v0.7.7** ships the Godot halves above plus `configure_physics_body` (collision layers and masks by layer number, friction and bounce, rigidbody dynamics for an existing body) and `run_gameplay_probe` — a headless playtest that presses InputMap actions on a schedule, tracks the player body, and reports per-step displacement, jump height, and fall detection, answering "does the gameplay work?" where `run_project(verify)` only answers "does it run without errors?".

### Fixed

- **Smithery bundle build on Windows.** `build_smithery_bundle.py` resolves `npx` via `shutil.which` so `CreateProcess` finds `npx.cmd`.

## [0.7.15] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- **Cloud knowledge base retrieval is now engine-aware (paid tier).** When a Godot session queries the curated knowledge base, it retrieves Godot documentation and API references instead of Unity content. The active engine is detected automatically, sent with the query, and the injected context block is labeled for that engine.

## [0.7.14] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- **Official MCP Registry namespace casing.** The registry matches the GitHub org namespace case-sensitively and GitHub OIDC grants `io.github.Glade-tool/*`, so `server.json` and the README ownership marker now use `Glade-tool`, not `glade-tool`. PyPI descriptions are immutable per version, so correcting the marker required a release.

## [0.7.13] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- **Listed on the Official MCP Registry and Smithery.** `server.json` describes the package for the registry; `manifest.json` plus `scripts/build_smithery_bundle.py` produce a local MCP Bundle (`.mcpb`) for Smithery. GladeKit is local-first — the server talks to the editor bridge on localhost — so a hosted URL cannot reach a user's editor and the local bundle is the correct distribution.
- **Unity 2D foundation — physics, tilemap, and parallax tools (258 → 268).** `add_rigidbody_2d` / `set_rigidbody_2d_properties`, `create_collider_2d` / `set_collider_2d_properties` (box, circle, and capsule auto-fit the sprite; polygon traces its outline), `create_physics_material_2d`, `create_tilemap`, `set_tilemap_tiles` (paint, erase, fill), `add_tilemap_collider_2d` (composite seams, one-way platforms), `get_tilemap_info`, and `create_parallax_layer`. The 3D reads fall back to the 2D components, and every 2D tool warns when 2D and 3D physics are mixed on one object — the classic silent 2D failure. Backed by a live-editor smoke suite that found and fixed three bridge bugs before release.
- **Godot bridge addon v0.7.6** ships `snap_to_ground`, the play-test fix, and `projectName` / `projectPath` on `health` so the desktop app's one-click update can locate the project authoritatively.
- **Bidirectional Unity bridge ↔ schema parity guard.** A C# tool renamed, removed, or implemented but never registered previously shipped silently dead; the test now parses the sources and fails on any of the three.

### Fixed

- **Kenney `input-prompts` download URL** refreshed after Kenney rotated the media URL (404 → 200), surfaced by the daily catalog-drift check.

## [0.7.12] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **Godot bridge addon v0.7.5 — spatial queries, locomotion blending, batch layout, and scene-flow (95 → 104 tools).** Schemas for these tools are now exposed to MCP clients.
  - **Spatial query trio (`raycast`, `overlap_shape`, `shape_cast`).** Query the scene's physics space directly at edit time — no play session needed — to reason about geometry while building. `raycast` reports the first collider along a ray (what's under a point, is there a wall between A and B). `overlap_shape` returns every collider inside a sphere/box at a point (who's within blast radius, is this spot clear). `shape_cast` sweeps a shape along a motion vector and reports how far it travels before first contact (how far can this body fall before it lands, would this character fit through here). All three are dimension-aware (2D/3D) with `collision_mask` and `exclude` support.
  - **`create_blend_space_1d`** — locomotion animation from a single scalar (the canonical idle → walk → run setup). Builds an `AnimationTree` rooted in an `AnimationNodeBlendSpace1D` over an existing `AnimationPlayer`; blend points are placed explicitly or auto-seeded from locomotion-tier clip names. Drive `blend_position` with a speed value (e.g. `velocity.length() / max_speed`). The 1D sibling of `create_blend_space_2d`.
  - **`arrange_nodes`** — position many nodes into a row, column, or grid in one call. Does the spacing math and sets global positions from a single anchor instead of computing each position by hand and moving nodes one at a time. Dimension is read from each node; 3D layouts lie on the X/Z ground plane.
  - **`create_scene_transition`** — register a full-screen scene-transition overlay as an autoload in one atomic call, turning hard scene cuts into smooth fades (menu ↔ game, level ↔ level, death/respawn).
  - **`look_at_game_view`** — capture a screenshot of the rendered editor view so the model can see the current scene and verify visuals — catching invisible/missing/mispositioned nodes that inspection alone cannot.
  - **`find_references`** — find every `.gd` script that references a symbol (a `class_name`, func, or var), matching whole identifiers only. **`find_scene_usages`** — the scene-wiring counterpart: find every `.tscn` that references a resource via `[ext_resource]`. Use both to see the blast radius before renaming or moving things.

### Changed

- **`get_animation_tree_info` now reads back blend spaces.** Previously it returned only the root type for any non-state-machine tree; it now describes `AnimationNodeBlendSpace1D` / `2D` roots in full (blend points, bounds, mode, labels, and the `blend_position` parameter) — the read-back counterpart of `create_blend_space_1d` / `create_blend_space_2d`.

## [0.7.11] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Godot bridge addon v0.7.4 — moving platforms, directional blending, per-object juice, and live particle tuning (4 new tools, 91 → 95).** Schemas for these tools are now exposed to MCP clients.
  - **`create_moving_platform`** — build a moving platform (or send an existing node patrolling a route) in one call, in **either 2D or 3D**: a waypoint curve, a vetted mover that drives the rider along it at constant speed, and a rider. The default rider is an `AnimatableBody2D` / `AnimatableBody3D` that genuinely **carries** a resting `CharacterBody` player (a `StaticBody` would let the player float when the platform reverses); pass `target_path` to send an existing node along instead, leaving its script intact. Dimension is inferred from the open scene's root. `loop_mode`: `loop` / `pingpong` / `once`.
  - **`create_blend_space_2d`** — directional sprite animation from a single 2D vector (the canonical 8/4-way walk setup). Builds an `AnimationTree` rooted in an `AnimationNodeBlendSpace2D` over an existing `AnimationPlayer`; blend points are placed explicitly or auto-seeded from directional clip names (`up` / `down` / `left` / `right`). Cardinal layout matches Godot's screen-space convention (+y is down), so `velocity.normalized()` feeds straight into `blend_position` with no axis flip.
  - **`create_juice`** — a reusable per-object "juice" node attached under a target `Node2D` / `Control` that tweens the target's scale and modulate from the outside, so it never clobbers the target's own script. Methods: `pop()` (overshoot-then-settle squash-stretch punch), `flash(color)`, `fade_in` / `fade_out`, `pop_in` (spawn scale-from-zero). Optional idle motion (`pulse` / `bob`) and spawn animation fire automatically. The per-object companion to `create_screen_shake`'s camera kick.
  - **`set_particles_properties`** — re-tune an existing `GPUParticles2D` after creation: switch preset, or override amount / lifetime / emission / velocity / gravity / color without rebuilding the node, so an effect can be dialed in iteratively.

- **One-way platforms (argument extensions, no new tools).** `set_tilemap_collision` gained `one_way` + `one_way_margin` (land on top of tiles, pass through from below), and `create_moving_platform` gained `one_way`. Discrete static platforms get one-way via the existing property setter.

### Changed

- **`run_project` self-healing verify mode.** `run_project` gained a `verify` flag for confirming a change you just made: it runs the project, captures output, and reports back so a mistake surfaces immediately instead of silently. Pass the edited scene explicitly when it isn't the project's main scene.

- **Scaffolder safety: warn on reused same-named scripts.** When a vetted scaffolder reuses an existing script of the same name rather than writing its own, any settings it would have queued onto a fresh script are now reported as dropped, so a silent no-op becomes a visible warning.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Godot bridge addon v0.7.1 — the combat loop (3 new tools, 88 → 91).** A scene could already have enemies and impact VFX, but nothing could fight: no way to shoot, no hit points, no on-screen health. These three vetted scaffolders close that loop, and they compose automatically.
  - **`create_projectile`** — the shoot verb. One call writes a flying projectile (an `Area2D` / `Area3D` that travels along its aim, damages the first node in a target group it overlaps, and self-frees on hit or after a lifetime) plus a Shooter added as a child of the player/turret that spawns one on an input action (default `shoot` on left-click). Dimension-aware (`space` inferred from the scene root): 2D aims at the mouse, 3D along the shooter's forward.
  - **`create_health`** — hit points. Attaches a reusable `Health` component (a child node, so it never collides with the target's own script; pure logic, so the same script works in 2D and 3D) exposing `take_damage(amount)` / `heal` / `is_alive`, with `max_health` + invulnerability frames + free-on-death, emitting `damaged` / `healed` / `died`. A projectile routes damage through a `Health` child automatically, turning one-shot-destroy into real multi-hit HP.
  - **`create_health_bar`** — the HUD. A `CanvasLayer` overlay (styled `ProgressBar` + a `current / max` readout) that finds a Health component (by default the `player` group's; set `target_group` for a boss), seeds from `max_health`, and follows its `damaged` / `healed` signals so HP is visible and live.

## [0.7.9] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Godot bridge addon v0.7.0 — first-class 2D support and a complete prototype-game toolkit (29 new tools, 60 → 88).** The bridge was previously 3D-biased; this release makes 2D a first-class citizen and adds vetted, one-call scaffolders for the pieces a playable prototype needs — controllers, enemies, a win/lose loop, menus, navigation, and juice. New tool schemas are exposed to MCP clients accordingly.
  - **Dimension awareness.** `get_project_info` reports the project's `workspace` and `get_scene_tree` reports the scene's `root_space` (`2d` / `3d`), so a client can tell which kind of scene it's editing. The dimension-aware creators (`create_camera`, `create_light`, `create_material`, `create_physics_body`) **infer** the space from the open scene's root when it isn't passed, so a bare `create_camera` in a 2D scene yields a `Camera2D`. Single-dimension tools attach a self-correcting hint when used in the other kind of scene. `create_camera` supersedes the old `create_camera_3d` name, which remains callable as an alias.
  - **2D scene building.** `create_sprite_2d`, `create_animated_sprite_2d` (with optional spritesheet slicing), `create_tilemap_layer` (TileMapLayer + TileSet atlas), `set_tilemap_cells` (paint / fill / erase), `set_tilemap_collision` (make tiles solid), and `create_parallax_2d` (scrolling backgrounds).
  - **Asset pipeline.** `import_asset` downloads and installs an external asset and `list_imported_assets` reports what's been brought in, with a license/attribution audit. Imports apply pixel-art-friendly texture filtering and seamless music looping where appropriate.
  - **Audio.** `create_audio_player` places a player and `set_audio_player_properties` configures it; stream assignment reuses the existing resource setter. Non-positional by default (music / UI), positional on request (`AudioStreamPlayer2D` / `3D`).
  - **AnimationTree state machine.** `create_animation_tree`, `add_state_machine_state`, `add_state_machine_transition`, and `get_animation_tree_info` — a state-machine animation layer over an existing `AnimationPlayer`.
  - **Vetted character controllers.** `create_third_person_controller` (3D) and `create_2d_controller` (`platformer` / `top_down`) write known-good movement scripts verbatim and assemble the player, camera, input actions, and (for platformers) ground — carrying the game-feel details a from-scratch script tends to drop (coyote time, jump buffering, variable jump height; normalized diagonals for top-down).
  - **Game feel / juice.** `create_particles_2d` and `create_particles_3d` add a tuned `GPUParticles2D` / `GPUParticles3D` from a preset (`explosion` / `sparkle` / `smoke` / `fire` / `trail`) — visible immediately, no texture needed. `create_screen_shake` attaches a trauma-based, noise-driven shake to the camera that composes with a follow camera.
  - **Gameplay loop.** `create_game_manager` builds a manager + HUD (score, lives, win/lose banner) and handles respawn and end-of-game; `create_collectible` and `create_hazard` add trigger areas that drive score and lives. The three compose into a winnable/losable game.
  - **Enemies.** `create_enemy_2d` (moving, stompable) and `create_enemy_3d` (line-of-sight guard behavior, with optional navmesh pursuit).
  - **3D navigation.** `add_navigation_agent` and `bake_navigation_mesh` set up pathfinding, including navmesh-driven enemy pursuit.
  - **Menus / scene flow.** `create_main_menu` (title screen) and `create_pause_menu` (in-game overlay) with working scene transitions.

## [0.7.8] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Godot bridge addon v0.6.6 — editor main-thread stall watchdog.** Tool execution waits on the Godot editor's main thread; when that thread wedges (an open modal dialog, a long synchronous import/scan), every queued and subsequent `tools/execute` call previously rode out the client's full 30s timeout with an opaque "timed out" error, making the bridge look dead even though it was reachable. Two-layer fix:
  - **Bridge:** the worker thread now expires `tools/execute` dispatches that sit undispatched for 25s and answers them with a structured error naming the stall ("editor's main thread has not processed bridge work for Xs") plus `possible_solutions[]` (dismiss the dialog / wait out the import / restart the editor). The `health` endpoint reports `mainThreadStalledMsec` — how long since the main thread last made progress — which stays readable during a stall because health answers from the worker thread. Dispatches are drained one at a time (previously bulk) so queued work stays visible to the watchdog while an earlier tool executes, and a long multi-tool batch refreshes the heartbeat between tools so "busy" isn't misreported as "wedged".
  - **MCP server:** a `tools/execute` timeout now triggers a follow-up health probe and appends a diagnosis to the error — editor wedged (with stall duration and the modal-dialog hint), editor healthy but tool slow (suggest retry/smaller steps), or bridge gone (editor crashed/closed). Works against older bridges too, with a less precise "busy or blocked" message when `mainThreadStalledMsec` is absent. New `GodotBridgeTimeoutError` (subclass of `GodotBridgeError`) distinguishes deadline expiry from transport failure.

### Fixed

- **Godot 4.6 compatibility in the bridge's editor-singleton probes.** On 4.6, `Engine.has_singleton("EditorInterface")` returns `true` even outside the editor (game-runtime / headless test context), but `Engine.get_singleton()` then raises a C++ "Can't retrieve singleton outside of editor" error. All EditorInterface lookups now route through a new `ToolUtils.get_editor_interface_safe()` gated on `Engine.is_editor_hint()`, so headless/GUT runs stay error-free. Also on 4.6, passing an already-freed node to a `Node`-typed parameter raises at the call boundary before any validity check can run — `ToolUtils.deselect_before_free` now takes an untyped parameter and validates inside, preserving its tolerate-freed-nodes contract.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Godot bridge addon v0.6.4 — context-engineering polish on two heavily-used reads (`get_script_content` pagination + `get_scene_tree` `response_format`).** Two tools with the highest per-call token footprint now expose knobs that let the agent pull only what it actually needs.
  - `get_script_content` is now paginated by line. New args `start_line` (1-indexed, default 1), `end_line` (1-indexed inclusive, default 0 = until EOF), and `max_lines` (default 500, clamped 1..5000) replace the previous "always return the whole file" behavior. The response always carries `total_lines` and `truncated` so the agent knows whether to request the next slice. Past-EOF reads return `success` with an empty `content` plus a diagnostic message so a wrong `start_line` self-corrects on the next call instead of looping. Non-agent callers that want the whole file in one shot can pass `max_lines=5000` (the hard cap).
  - `get_scene_tree` gains a `response_format` arg: `"both"` (default, returns the nested JSON `tree` AND the ASCII `tree_text`), `"tree_text_only"` (drops the JSON tree — ~half the response size on large scenes, and the ASCII view is already the model-friendly one), or `"tree_only"` (drops the ASCII for programmatic callers). Scene metadata (`scene_path`, `node_count`) is in every mode. Unknown formats return a structured error with `possible_solutions` listing the valid values. The aggregating `context/gather` endpoint pins `response_format="both"` so it keeps returning both shapes regardless of future default changes.
- **Godot bridge addon v0.6.3 — 2D physics bodies in `create_physics_body`.** `create_physics_body` previously built only 3D bodies, so 2D games (platformers, top-down) had no one-call body + collision setup. A new `space` arg (`"3d"` default / `"2d"`) switches the node family: `space="2d"` creates a `StaticBody2D` / `RigidBody2D` / `CharacterBody2D` with a matching `CollisionShape2D` child — `box`→`RectangleShape2D`, `circle`→`CircleShape2D`, `capsule`→`CapsuleShape2D` — sized in pixels (default 32×32) at a 2D position. The 3D path is unchanged (regression-tested). Adds `ToolUtils.parse_vector2_arg` so 2-component `"x,y"` values (2D positions and shape sizes) parse correctly instead of silently falling back to defaults.
- **Godot bridge addon v0.6.2 — `set_node_property` (generic node configuration).** `create_node` can spawn any node class, but configuring the result previously required a specialized setter per concern (transform, resource, light, material). `set_node_property` sets any non-Resource property on any node via reflection — scalars, vectors, colors, booleans, and enums — so `AudioStreamPlayer.volume_db`, `Camera3D.fov`, `GPUParticles3D.amount`, `RigidBody3D.mass`, and the like are all reachable through one tool. Values coerce to the property's declared type (numeric strings → numbers, `"x,y,z"` / `[x,y,z]` → vectors, `"#rrggbb"` → colors, enum labels like `"PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS"` → their int); Resource-typed properties are rejected with a redirect to `set_node_resource`; unknown names return the node's settable properties plus the nearest match. `get_node_info` gains an `include_properties` flag that returns the current values of exactly those settable properties, so a client can read before it writes.
- **Godot bridge addon v0.6.1 — `add_input_action` (InputMap action setup).** A fresh Godot project ships with only the engine `ui_*` defaults, so a movement/jump/interact script that calls `Input.is_action_pressed("move_forward")` or `Input.get_vector(...)` against custom action names errors on every frame — and there was previously no tool to define those actions. `add_input_action` registers (or replaces) a custom action and binds keyboard keys to it: the action is saved to `project.godot` (survives restarts, appears under Project Settings > Input Map) and mirrored into the live `InputMap` so it fires the moment the project runs. Keys bind as physical keys (WASD survives non-QWERTY layouts), key names accept editor-style strings (`"W"`, `"Space"`, `"Escape"`, arrow keys), unrecognized names return `possible_solutions[]`, and re-running with `overwrite=true` (the default) is idempotent. Refused during play mode.

### Fixed

- **Scene-root node-path resolution.** Path-targeting tools (`create_primitive_3d`, `set_node_transform`, `set_node_parent`, and others that resolve a `parent_path` / node path) failed with `Parent node '<Name>' not found` when an agent named the scene root itself — e.g. `parent_path: "Main"` when the edited scene root is `Main`. The resolver's descendant search never matched the root node, so the most natural way to reference the root broke. It now resolves a bare root name, and strips a leading root-name segment from a slash path (`"Main/Player"` → `Player` under root), removing a class of avoidable failures.

- **Godot bridge addon v0.6.0 — AnimationPlayer + Animation .tres scaffolding (5 tools).** Closes the gap between an empty AnimationPlayer + an empty Animation resource and a playable, scene-saved animation library:
  - `add_animation_to_player` — register an Animation .tres with a player under a library + name (default library `""`, the conventional setup). Creates the library on first registration; refuses to overwrite an existing entry.
  - `add_animation_track` — add a track to an Animation. Five track types: `value` (any property — path `Node:property`), `position_3d` / `rotation_3d` / `scale_3d` (Node3D transform — more efficient than value-track equivalents), `method` (calls a function at keyframes).
  - `add_animation_keyframe` — insert a keyframe at time T with value V. Value parsing dispatches on the track's type read from the resource: Vector3 for position/scale, Quaternion (auto-converted from Euler degrees to match `set_node_transform`'s convention) for rotation, pass-through for value/method.
  - `set_animation_properties` — length, loop_mode (`"none" | "linear" | "ping_pong"` or 0/1/2), step. Refuses empty calls noisily (set_node_transform's 0.5.8 pattern).
  - `get_animation_player_info` — read-only inspection: libraries + animations + playback state + top-level properties (root_node, autoplay, default blend time). Safe in play mode.
  - The AnimationPlayer node and Animation .tres themselves are created via existing `create_node(type='AnimationPlayer')` + `create_resource(type='Animation')`, so the five tools above close the workflow without duplicating those creators. Typical scaffold for a 0.6s jump: `create_node` → `create_resource` → `add_animation_to_player` → `add_animation_track(position_3d)` → 3× `add_animation_keyframe` (t=0/0.3/0.6) → `set_animation_properties(length=0.6, loop_mode='none')`.
- **Godot bridge addon v0.5.9** — unknown-tool typo recovery. When `tools/execute` receives a tool name that isn't registered, the dispatcher now returns up to 3 levenshtein-ranked neighbors as `possible_solutions[]`, capped at edit distance 4 from the input. Previously the error was a naked `"Unknown tool '<name>'"` with no recovery surface, so a single-character typo (`get_node_inf` instead of `get_node_info`) cost the agent a round-trip through `tools/list` to find the right name. Threshold tuned to catch single-character drops/swaps in the 12–20-char tool-name range without surfacing spurious hits on wild-miss queries. Reuses the `ToolUtils.levenshtein` helper that v0.5.8 already extracted for inner-tool typo paths (`create_resource` class names, `connect_signal` signal names).
- **Godot bridge addon v0.5.8** with three rounds of hardening + test backfill:
  - `tools/execute` now distinguishes a tool that halted (null return — likely an unhandled runtime error) from a tool that returned the wrong shape, and `push_error`s either case to the editor Output panel so the user can correlate with the underlying stack trace. Previously both collapsed to a generic "returned non-Dictionary" message.
  - `context/gather` is now atomic: `success=false` when any sub-fetch (project info, scene tree) fails, with the failed source list baked into `message`/`error`. Previously the aggregator returned `success=true` even when sub-tools failed, so a client that only checked the top-level flag could silently consume incomplete context.
  - `PlaySessionManager` now mirrors active session PIDs to `user://gladekit-godot-bridge/sessions.json` and reaps orphan processes on bridge startup. Plugin hot-reload (editing any addon `.gd` file) previously orphaned the running `godot` subprocess because static state was reset; the bridge now kills the survivor on the next start.
  - `set_node_transform` refuses calls with none of position/rotation/scale (was silent no-op).
  - `BackupManager` now `push_error`s once-per-session if `ProjectSettings.globalize_path("res://")` returns empty (a hard editor-state failure that would otherwise silently disable all backups + the revert flow). New `BackupManager.is_available()` lets callers preflight before committing to a mutation turn.
  - `get_runtime_events` now mentions ring-buffer overflow in the `message` field when `dropped_due_to_overflow > 0`, so a noisy session can't silently truncate the visible event tail.
  - **New tests**: `test_ui_tools.gd` (14 tests across all 6 UI/Control tools — previously the entire category had zero coverage), `test_uid_tools.gd` (Godot 4.4+ ResourceUID, version-gated to skip cleanly on 4.3), and `test_ws_e2e.gd` (boots a real WS server + sends real JSON frames through `WebSocketPeer` — the first true end-to-end transport-pipeline test).
  - **Code quality**: extracted `parse_color_arg` and `levenshtein` into `ToolUtils`, removing five duplicate `_color_from` implementations and two duplicate `_levenshtein` implementations across `resource/`, `camera/`, and `signal/` tools.
## [0.7.5] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **`create_script` overwrite guard.** Sibling hole to the shipped `modify_script` gate — previously a model could clobber any real project script by calling `create_script` with a colliding path. The bridge now refuses `create_script` when the target path already exists on disk and was not created in the current session via `create_script`, unless the caller passes `confirmExistingFileModification=true` (same flag name as `modify_script` so the agent learns one pattern). Schema description updated lockstep on the MCP server so clients see the new arg + the new behavior contract.
- **Godot bridge addon v0.4.6** with the new `context/gather` endpoint: one round-trip returns project metadata + scene tree (including the model-friendly flat `tree_text`) + recent-error history. Replaces the 2–3 separate `tools/execute` calls a fresh session would otherwise need to orient the agent. MCP clients can call it directly if they want the same aggregation.
- **Godot bridge addon v0.4.5** with `create_resource` — generic factory for any concrete Resource subclass (BoxMesh, Shape3D variants, Curve, Environment, AudioStream, Gradient, …). Composition partner to the v0.4.4 `set_node_resource`: create the `.tres` here, then assign it there. Refuses Material/Script types with a redirect to the dedicated creators so the three resource creators stay cleanly partitioned.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **`create_resource` Godot tool.** Generic factory for any concrete `Resource` subclass — `BoxMesh`, every `Shape3D`, `Curve`/`Curve2D`/`Curve3D`, `Environment`, `AudioStream` subclasses, `Gradient`/`GradientTexture*`, and more. Composition partner to the v0.4.4 `set_node_resource`: create the `.tres` here, then assign it there. Refuses `Material`/`Script` types with a redirect to `create_material`/`create_script` so the three resource creators stay cleanly partitioned. On unknown class names returns up to 5 edit-distance-ranked suggestions; on abstract types returns concrete subclasses. Ships with Godot bridge addon **v0.4.5**.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Re-publish after a PyPI trusted-publisher hiccup blocked the 0.7.2 upload. No code changes from 0.7.2.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **`get_project_info` Godot tool.** Single-call snapshot of a Godot project: name, version, renderer, main scene, currently edited scene, counts of scenes/scripts/resources, enabled addons, and (in `response_format="detailed"`) bounded file listings, top-level directories, and the project's custom input actions (engine builtins like `ui_accept` are filtered out). Replaces the 4-5 exploratory calls an agent typically makes when dropped into an unfamiliar project. Read-only and safe in play mode.
- **3 Godot signal-wiring tools** for editor-time, scene-saved (CONNECT_PERSIST) signal connections — the same kind of wiring you'd otherwise make through the Godot editor's Node panel:
  - `connect_signal` — wire an emitter's signal to a target method (idempotent; refuses to wire nonexistent signals or methods with closest-match suggestions).
  - `list_signal_connections` — read existing wiring on a node; `response_format="detailed"` also lists every signal declared on the node.
  - `disconnect_signal` — remove a persistent connection; never silently no-ops.
- **`set_node_resource` Godot tool** (bridge v0.4.4). Assign a Resource loaded from a `res://` path to any Resource-typed property on a node. One consolidated tool instead of a separate `assign_*` per resource kind.

### Fixed

- **Godot bridge `/health` endpoint reported the wrong version.** A hardcoded version constant in the bridge silently drifted from `plugin.cfg` during a bump, so up-to-date users saw false "stale bridge" warnings from the MCP server. The bridge now reads its version dynamically from `plugin.cfg` at startup, and a regression-guard test refuses to merge any future hardcoded version constant.
- **`connect_signal` typo suggestions are much more useful.** A 1-character typo like `timeput` (for `timeout`) or `request_redy` (for `request_ready`) now returns the actual closest match instead of an alphabetical fallback. Uses Levenshtein edit-distance matching with a noise filter that drops weak runners-up when the top match is clearly correct.
- **`connect_signal` schema description** for `method_name` now correctly notes that built-in class methods (`queue_free`, `request_ready`, etc.) are valid targets, not just script-declared methods. The previous wording would have steered agents away from a working path.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Godot engine support (4.3+).** The MCP server now drives the Godot editor in addition to Unity. On startup it probes the local bridges and exposes the matching tool set — Unity if the Unity bridge is reachable on `:8765`, Godot if the Godot bridge is reachable on `:8766`. Set `GLADEKIT_MCP_FORCE_ENGINE=unity|godot` to skip the probe and pin an engine (useful when both editors are open).
- **33 native Godot tools** across scene/node (create/find/transform/reparent/duplicate/delete nodes), GDScript (create/modify/read/find scripts + node attachment), camera & light, resources (materials), physics bodies, scene I/O (`.tscn` create/open/save/instantiate), a live play-session loop (`run_project` → `get_debug_output` → `stop_project`), and Godot 4.4+ `ResourceUID` handling.
- **Godot bridge addon** (`com.gladekit.mcp-bridge` for Godot, v0.3.1) — a thread-based WebSocket server for the Godot editor, installed by copying into `addons/`. See the README's Godot Quick Start.

### Notes

- Unity behavior is unchanged: the Unity HTTP path is byte-identical, and a session with no engine declared defaults to Unity. Existing Unity clients require no changes.
- `0.7.0` was tagged but never published — a CI-only test that assumed the Godot bridge sources sit alongside `mcp-server/` failed in the published-repo layout (they ship from a separate repo). The test now skips when those sources are absent; `0.7.1` is the first published release with Godot support.

## [0.6.8] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- **0.6.7 bridge install fails to compile in fresh UPM clients.** The two new files (`BridgeDiagnostics.cs`, `BridgeDiagnostics_RingBuffer.cs`) shipped without their `.meta` siblings. Unity's PackageCache is immutable, so missing meta files cause the assets to be silently dropped on import — the `BridgeDiagnostics` type ceases to exist and `GladeKitMCPWindow.cs` fails with CS0246. Adds the meta files. No other changes from 0.6.7.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- **`compile_scripts` no longer surfaces a false `ReadTimeout` and wedge the bridge on large projects.** On projects with thousands of assets or pending imports, the bridge's `AssetDatabase.Refresh()` call inside `compile_scripts` can block the Unity main thread for well past the default 30s HTTP timeout. The MCP client would surface `Unity bridge error for compile_scripts: ReadTimeout`, then every retry would queue behind the still-running Refresh and time out the same way — making the bridge appear permanently stuck until the Editor was restarted. A per-tool override in the dispatcher now gives `compile_scripts` 180s, which matches the actual cost on a cold scene-open without removing the finite ceiling.

### Added

- **`Restart` button in `Window > GladeKit MCP`.** Stops and restarts the bridge HTTP server in one click — drains any in-flight async tool handles and queued requests before rebinding to `localhost:8765`. Use this when the bridge appears unresponsive instead of restarting the entire Unity Editor.
- **Bridge Diagnostics panel in `Window > GladeKit MCP`.** A 50-entry ring buffer of bridge lifecycle and fault events (server start/stop/restart, HTTP request errors, tool execution faults, async-deadline hits) rendered newest-first with absolute and relative timestamps. Makes wedged-bridge incidents self-diagnosing without scraping the Unity Console. Cleared on Editor domain reload — fresh sessions start clean.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **Semantic search no longer crashes the server on a broken install env.** `numpy` and `openai` are now lazy-imported inside `search.py` instead of at module load. If either is missing (e.g. a `uv tool install` whose env was never refreshed after a dependency was added, or a platform where numpy fails to build), the MCP server still starts — semantic search auto-disables with a clear stderr warning instead of taking the whole server down with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'`.
- **`import_asset` no longer surfaces a false "import failed" error on multi-MB Kenney packs.** The default 30s HTTP timeout was too short for download + extract + per-file Unity importer config + `AssetDatabase.Refresh()`. A per-tool override in the dispatcher now gives `import_asset` 300s, which matches the actual work it does. Previously, the MCP client would time out and report failure even when the Unity bridge eventually completed the import successfully.
- **Bridge HTTP errors with empty `__str__` now surface the exception class name.** `httpx.ReadTimeout` and `httpx.ConnectError` sometimes raise without a message string, which produced `"Unity bridge error for import_asset: "` with an empty tail. The bridge dispatcher now falls back to the exception type name (`"Unity bridge error for import_asset: ReadTimeout"`) so failures are self-diagnosing.

### Changed

- Tightened the `find_asset` tool description so LLM clients route asset-discovery requests to the bundled CC0 catalog instead of defaulting to web search. No behavioral or schema change — description-only.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- **Bundled Kenney catalog now ships with working download URLs.** v0.5.1 shipped a catalog with every `download_url` field set to `null`, so `import_asset` calls failed for all 17 packs. 13 of 17 packs now have resolved URLs; the remaining 4 are flagged for the next `scripts/build_kenney_index.py` refresh.
- Corrected the catalog `notes` field that incorrectly described the runtime provider as scraping `official_page` at fetch time. The provider reads pre-baked `download_url` values from the catalog; the refresh script (`scripts/build_kenney_index.py`) is the only component that scrapes, and it runs at index-refresh time, not at request time.
- `_reload_tools_pkg` test helper now also clears the cached `tools` attribute on the parent `gladekit_mcp` package, so the `GLADEKIT_MCP_DISABLE_ASSET_PIPELINE` env-var toggle is actually re-read across test cases.

### Added

- **Asset pipeline (3 new tools).** Find and import free CC0 assets directly from your AI client; ships with a [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl) catalog and orchestrator bundled into the MCP server (no cloud dependency).
  - `find_asset` — read-only search across asset providers. Returns ranked candidates with name, description, license, license summary, official page, approximate asset count, and a relevance score. Filterable by `asset_type` (`sprite_2d` / `model_3d` / `audio_sfx` / `audio_music` / `animation` / `ui_sprite`), free-text `style` (`pixel art`, `vector`, `low-poly`, `voxel`), explicit `tags`, and `license_constraint`. Runs entirely against the bundled Kenney catalog — works offline.
  - `import_asset` — downloads the resolved asset, extracts (zip) into `Assets/<targetPath>/`, configures Unity import settings for the asset type (`TextureImporter` for sprites with pixel-art-friendly defaults — Sprite mode, Point filter, Uncompressed; `ModelImporter` for 3D; `AudioImporter` for audio), and writes a `.gladekit-asset.json` sidecar with license metadata. Requires explicit `licenseAcknowledged: true`.
  - `list_imported_assets` — read-only audit. Walks `.gladekit-asset.json` sidecars under `Assets/`, returns license counts and attribution-required count. Supports `licenseFilter` to filter by a specific license. Useful before a commercial release.
- **Bundled orchestrator (`gladekit_mcp.asset_pipeline/`).** Self-contained search and URL resolution — the asset pipeline runs entirely inside the MCP server with no external service dependency.
- **Two layers of toggle for studios with curated-asset workflows:**
  - **MCP server:** set `GLADEKIT_MCP_DISABLE_ASSET_PIPELINE=1` in the server environment. The three tools are stripped from the tool list and dispatch refuses with a clear error.
  - **Unity bridge:** `EditorPrefs["GladeAI.AssetPipelineEnabled"]` (default `true`). Toggleable via `POST /api/settings { "assetPipelineEnabled": false }`. Enforced by `AssetPipelineGuard` on every asset-pipeline tool — defense-in-depth in case a misconfigured client makes it through.
  - The state is also surfaced on `GET /api/health` as `assetPipelineEnabled` so clients can detect and reflect the bridge-side setting.
- **License + attribution discipline.** Every imported asset bundle gets a `.gladekit-asset.json` sidecar recording: candidate id, provider, license, attribution string, source URL, import timestamp, asset type, target path, and imported file paths. `list_imported_assets` reads these to surface required attributions before shipping.

### Security

- **The LLM never sees download URLs.** `import_asset` accepts `candidateId` from the LLM; the MCP server's preprocessor calls the orchestrator to resolve the actual download URL and injects it into the bridge call as underscore-prefixed fields the schema does not advertise. Any LLM attempt to set `_resolvedUrl` / `_resolvedLicense` / etc. is stripped before the orchestrator lookup, so a fabricated URL never survives even when resolution fails.
- **License acknowledgment is a hard gate.** Both the MCP-side preprocessor and the Unity bridge tool require `licenseAcknowledged: true` and refuse with a clear error otherwise. Set this only after the user has explicitly accepted the license shown by `find_asset`.
- **Bridge-side URL host allowlist (defense in depth).** Even if a client bypasses both the cloud and MCP preprocessors and sends `import_asset` directly to the bridge with a forged `_resolvedUrl`, the bridge refuses to download from any host outside the per-provider allowlist in `AssetPipelineGuard.IsResolvedUrlHostAllowed` (Kenney → `kenney.nl` / `www.kenney.nl`, HTTPS only). Adding a new provider to the orchestrator requires adding its hosts here too — the bridge fails closed on unknown providers.

### Notes

- v1 ships Kenney.nl only. Additional providers (Freesound for SFX, Quaternius / Poly Pizza for 3D, AI generation via Replicate / PixelLab / Meshy / ElevenLabs) are on the roadmap.
- Tool count is now 235+ across 16 categories (was 230+ across 15).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Runtime / Live Loop tools (5 new).** A small surface for agents that want to watch a Unity Play session for runtime errors and orchestrate fixes:
  - `start_runtime_observation` / `stop_runtime_observation` — arm/disarm runtime-event capture; the start call snapshots a baseline cursor so you only get events from arming forward.
  - `get_runtime_events` — incremental cursor-based poll for `Error` / `Exception` log entries during Play Mode. Returns events with a stable per-event fingerprint (`condition + first 500 chars of stack`) plus `playModeActive`, `observationActive`, and `nextCursor` for the next call.
  - `get_play_mode_state` — read-only snapshot of Play Mode state (isPlaying, last enter/exit timestamps, observation arming status). Useful for "watch for Play exit then act" flows.
  - `apply_queued_fix` — idempotent multi-step fix dispatcher keyed on `proposalId`. Each `change` is a `{toolName, args, rationale}` triple dispatched through the same path as direct tool calls (so DemoAssetsGuard and SessionTracker hooks fire uniformly). A second call with the same `proposalId` returns `alreadyApplied:true` with the prior result instead of re-executing — safe for retry-on-blip flows.
- **Bridge services to back the Runtime tools (in `unity-bridge/`):** `RuntimeLogStream` (500-entry ring buffer with monotonic cursors and condition-only legacy drain for the existing `/api/console/events` endpoint), `PlayModeObserver` (Play Mode lifecycle tracker, survives domain reload), and `FixApplyTracker` (idempotency registry capped at 200 entries).
- New `runtime` tool category exposed via the standard category-aware filter; the 5 tools are also added to `CORE_TOOLS` so they appear in Claude Code's default tool list.

### Changed

- **`/api/console/events` endpoint behavior change (internal, wire-compatible).** The legacy drain no longer mutates the ring buffer — it tracks a per-server `_legacyDrainCursor` and returns events past it. This lets cursor-based consumers (`get_runtime_events`) and the legacy drain coexist without stealing events from each other. The HTTP response shape is unchanged.
- **`UnityBridgeServer` slimmed by ~50 LOC.** The inline `Application.logMessageReceivedThreaded` subscription + 50-entry queue moved into `RuntimeLogStream`. The bridge static ctor no longer hooks the log event itself.

### Notes

- `propose_fix` is intentionally NOT exposed via the MCP server — the bridge has no handler for it. MCP clients should construct fix payloads themselves and dispatch via `apply_queued_fix` directly.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-05-03

### Changed

- **`gladekit version` now suggests the right upgrade command for your install method.** uvx (the recommended install path) caches resolved versions and won't pick up new releases without `--refresh`, but the previous output unconditionally said `pip install --upgrade gladekit-mcp` — which strands uvx users (pip often isn't on PATH, and the suggested command wouldn't update the cached uvx env even if it ran). Now detects uvx-managed envs via `sys.executable` and prints `uvx --refresh gladekit-mcp` instead.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- **Duplicate `compile_scripts` tool name broke Windsurf.** The schema was registered in both `tools/core.py` and `tools/scripting.py`; the aggregator concatenated both, so MCP `tools/list` returned the same name twice. Claude Code tolerated it, but Windsurf strictly enforces the MCP spec's "unique tool names" rule and bricked the chat with `Duplicate tool name: mcp_*_compile_scripts` until the server was disabled. Removed the stub in `core.py` (kept the richer `scripting.py` definition). Reported by an OSS user against `gladekit-mcp` v0.4.2/v0.4.3.

### Changed

- **Defense-in-depth dedupe in `registry.get_mcp_tools()`.** Now dedupes by name (keeping the first occurrence) and emits a `logger.warning` on collision, so a future regression keeps the wire MCP-compliant and surfaces the bug instead of breaking strict clients.
- **`test_no_duplicate_tool_names` is now strict** — previously allowlisted `compile_scripts` as a "known duplicate". Any future duplicate fails CI.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **Six more mutating tools no longer silently drop nested-array args.** Fifth pass of the input-resolution audit. Each tool received a `transforms`/`maps`/`axes`/`motions`/`spriteOrder` array via the schema, but the bridge's flat JSON parser left nested arrays as raw strings — the `is List<object>` type-check then silently failed when the call routed through `batch_execute`. Affected tools: `set_transform_batch`, `set_input_action_bindings`, `ensure_legacy_input_axes`, `create_blend_tree_1d`, `create_blend_tree_2d`, `create_sprite_animation_clip`. All now re-hydrate via `TryParseJsonArrayToList` matching the convention from the fourth pass.
- **`set_input_action_bindings` was the worst silent-success case** — returned `"Updated InputActionAsset bindings"` while applying nothing. Now returns structured `mapsUpdated` / `actionsUpdated` / `bindingsAdded` counts and recursively re-hydrates the nested `actions` and `bindings` arrays inside each map. Live verification surfaced two additional pre-existing bugs in this tool that the deep-parse fix made reachable for the first time: (1) `FindActionMap(name, throwIfNotFound: true)` throws instead of returning null, defeating the `?? AddActionMap` find-or-create fallback (changed to default `false`); (2) `.inputactions` files serialize as JSON, not YAML — `EditorUtility.SetDirty + AssetDatabase.SaveAssets` was a silent no-op for the file. Now persists via `asset.ToJson()` + `File.WriteAllText` + `AssetDatabase.ImportAsset`.
- **`create_blend_tree_1d` / `create_blend_tree_2d` surface skipped motions.** Previously returned `success=true, motionCount=0` when motions were requested but failed to resolve (silent failure mode the audit is designed to catch). Now return structured `skippedMotions` per-entry reasons (`clipPath is required`, `AnimationClip not found at clipPath`) and **error** when `requestedMotions > 0 && motionCount == 0`.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **`set_animation_clip_curves` no longer silently drops curves.** The Python schema advertised `componentType` and `keys` while the C# bridge read `type` and `keyframes` — clients following the schema got every curve dropped with success message "Set 0 curve(s)". The bridge now accepts both naming variants for forward compatibility, and curves that fail to land surface a structured `skippedCurves` array with per-entry reasons.
- **Type strings now resolve from short names.** `Transform`, `SpriteRenderer`, `GameObject`, etc. are accepted alongside fully-qualified names. The previous `System.Type.GetType` lookup silently returned null for short names, dropping the curve.
- **Zero-applied-with-skips now returns an error.** Calls that produce `curvesAdded=0` but had per-entry skip reasons return `success=false` instead of a misleading success.
- **`get_animation_clip_curves` reads back curves correctly.** It was walking SerializedObject fields that don't exist (`propertyName`/`type` vs the actual `attribute`/`classID`), returning empty for clips that had data. Replaced with the canonical `AnimationUtility.GetCurveBindings` API.
- **`set_animation_curve_tangents` accepts non-Transform bindings.** Optional `type` arg lets callers tangent-tune `SpriteRenderer`, `MeshRenderer`, or custom MonoBehaviour curves. On a curve miss, the response enumerates up to 20 actual clip bindings as `path|propertyName|type` strings so the next call can target a real one.
- **`remove_animation_clip_curves` distinguishes failure modes.** Returns structured per-entry skip reasons distinguishing `unresolvedType` from `notFoundOnClip`.
- **`set_sprite_animation_curves` reports skipped frames.** Per-keyframe skip tracking with `similarSprites` hints (filename-based search across `t:Sprite` then `t:Texture2D`) when a sprite asset can't be loaded. Returns `success=false` when zero keyframes parse.

### Internal

- All three setters now re-hydrate JSON-array args via `TryParseJsonArrayToList`. The bridge's flat JSON parser leaves nested arrays as raw strings; the previous `is List<object>` check silently failed for any caller routed through `batch_execute`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- **`openai` and `numpy` are now default dependencies.** Script semantic search works out of the box as soon as `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set — no install flags needed. Previously these packages shipped behind the `[search]` extra, which caused silent fallback to unranked results when users set the key without first reinstalling with the extra.

### Removed

- **Dropped `[search]` and `[all]` optional-dependency extras.** They are now redundant. If your install command includes `gladekit-mcp[search]` or `gladekit-mcp[all]`, drop the suffix — plain `gladekit-mcp` now bundles everything the `[search]` extra contained. The `[http]` extra is retained for explicit pinning of `starlette`/`uvicorn`.

### Migration

No config changes required. If you previously launched the server with:

```json
{ "command": "uvx", "args": ["gladekit-mcp[search]"] }
```

simplify to:

```json
{ "command": "uvx", "args": ["gladekit-mcp"] }
```

Semantic search activates automatically when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present in the `env` block.
